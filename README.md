Yelp is a platform where businesses that offer services are listed, allowing users to provide ratings and feedback. The dataset 'set_date_examen1.csv' includes Yelp reviews and ratings for US restaurants, featuring three variables:

**rest_id:** The unique ID of the restaurant

**text:** The review text

**rating:** A score from 1 to 5

**TASKS:**
1. Sentiment Analysis 
    Perform two sentiment analyses on the dataset:
    - Using the DTM/BOW approach or Tokenization + padding
    - Using Word2vec or FastText embeddings 

2. Model Selection and Implementation
    - Use text representation + a classification algorithm OR deep learning models or transformers (e.g., BERT). Choose only one approach. You are not restricted to the methods taught in the course.
    - Create a classification report.
    - Interpretation of results.

3. Model Comparison 
    - Compare the two models and determine which one performs best.
